### Introduction

In this project, we are going to analyze the Dutch game called _Boeren Bridge_. It is a card game played with four players, in which the objective is to obtain the most points, by correctly guessing the amount of tricks the player himself will take.

[This](https://github.com/JeroenVanB/LAMAS) is the link to our github repository.

### Game Rules

#### Variations

There are many variants of the game: 'Oh hell!', 'Wizard' or 'Nomination Whist'. We decided to implement a version, which we ourselves usually play. To prevent state explosion, we simplified some game rules, e.g. the amount of cards. We implemented a version with 5 rounds and only the highest cards of the normal deck of cards are used. The trump changes each round and is chosen randomly.

#### Points

The aim of the game is to get the most points. Points can be obtained by winning tricks and (most importantly) correctly guessing how many tricks the player himself will take in a round.
If the player correctly guesses the total number of tricks he has taken, he will receive two points for each trick taken, with a 10 points bonus. A special reward is given to players if they correctly guess taking 0 tricks, in rounds with 6 or more cards. Here, the bonus points increase from 10 to 20.
If the player guesses wrong, he will get two points subtracted for each trick he was off. The player with the most points after 15 rounds wins the game.

#### Gameplay

In each round, each player is given _n_ cards. From a separate set of cards, one random card is picked to determine the trump of the round. Starting by the player to the left of the dealer _P<sub>1</sub>_ and continuing clockwise, every player _P_ âˆˆ \{_P<sub>1</sub>_, _P<sub>2</sub>_, _P<sub>3</sub>_, _P<sub>4</sub>_\} guesses the number of tricks he will win. (In the rare occasion that all the guesses sum up to _n_, the dealer has to change his guess. He has to increase or decrease his original guess with 1 such that the total is not a sum equal to _n_.)

Next, _t_ = _n_ tricks are played, in which each player plays one card. During the first trick _t_<sub>1</sub>, the player left of the dealer starts. In the following rounds, the winner of the previous trick starts. The starting player is called _the opener_. Every player after the opener, should play a card matching the suit of the card played by the opener. If this is not possible, the player may play any card of his choice.

#### Winning tricks

The player who played the highest card during a trick, takes the trick. The cards follow the usual order, where 2 is the lowest and Ace is the highest (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace). When a player plays a card of a different suit than the opener, it is considered the lowest and can never win. Trump cards, however, are always higher than the other cards.

#### Number of cards

The number of cards depend on the rumber of rounds. The number of rounds can usually freedly be determined by the players. We chose to play 5 rounds.
In every round _r_, the players is dealt _t<sub>r</sub>_ cards. First, starting in the first round with _t<sub>1</sub>_ = 3. In each following round, every player is given _t<sub>r</sub>_ = _t<sub>r-1</sub>_+1 cards, up to 5 cards in total (in round 3). Then, starting with 2 more rounds are played, where the amount of cards decreases by 1. The game ends after round 5, where \_n<sub>5</sub>=3. See the table below for clarification.
To decrease the possible states, we minimized the amount of cards used in the game. This way it is known which cards are in the game and wich are not. E.g. in round 1, only the (Queen, King, Ace) of all the suits are used. This is also clarified in the table below.

### Game implementation

The game is made in Python (with pygame), using an MVC pattern and a object oriented approach. In the GameModel class, all the logic of the game is handled. The classes _Player_, _Deck_ and _Card_ facilitate an easy implementation of the logic.

##### Card Class

An instance Card Class represents a clard, by keeping track of the rank, suit, owner and the value. The base value is determined by the rank, as shown in Table 2. When a card is played, the value is influenced by the trump and trick suit. When a card has the same suit as the trick suit, its value is increased by 13. When a card has the same suit as the trump, its value is incrased by 26.

    <td>King</td>
    <td>11</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Ace</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Deck Class

During the game only one instance of the Deck class is present. It keeps track of all the cards in the game. The amount of cards in the deck depends on the round, as explained in the section Game Rules.

##### Player Class

The player class is an abstract class in which some basic functions are defined, such as _calculate_score()_ and _play_card()_. Many other functions consider finding a specific card of the player e.g. _get_highest_card()_ and _get_lowest_card_of_suit()_. These functions are defined here, since they can be used in different types of tactics.
The abstract class _Player_ is extended by different types of agents, such as _RandomAgent_ (which plays random cards), _GreedyAgent_ (which plays the highest cards) and _GreedyKripkeAgent_ (which uses kripke models). These subclasses override the function _pick_card()_ and _guess_wins()_, in which the tactics are implemented.

##### GameModel Class

The GameModel contains all the variables and functions to run the game. The function _next_move()_ keeps being executed in the main loop. It determines whose turn it is and checks if a trick, round or game should start or end.
At the start of each round, the cards are dealt, a trump is chosen en the _opener_ is determined. In the next four steps, each player plays a card, which is added to the dictionary _table_. After the last player, _determine_winner()_ checks who played the winning card. That player becomes the new _opener_. After all the tricks of a round are finished, the points are calculated for each player. After the final round, the game ends.

### Visualization

To visualize the game and the Kripke models a UI class is constructed. The UI is made using Pygame which enables you to draw basic shapes such as rectangles, lines and text to positions on the screen. Cards are visualized by showing their images on the screen. In the image below you can see the full visualisation of the game and Kripke model.

![Visualisation of the game and Kripke models](game_UI.png)

#### Game UI

The left hand side of the UI shows the game information such as the current round, scores, trump and trick suits. For each player we show his hand to the user. Do note that the cards are ofcourse not visible to the players in the game. They have to rely on their knowledge about the game. At the center of the table you can see all players guesses and how many rounds they have actually won untill now. The game will be paused after each move so that the user has the time to observe all game and model changes. When the user presses the spacebar the game will continue to the next move of the current player. The player, game and model states will be updated internally. The UI class is notified that there is a change and it will redraw all game elements on the left hand side of the screen.

#### Message box

To give the user a better overview of what is happening in the game and models we added a status box at the bottom. This box shows messages such as who's turn it is to play, what the trump is for this round or what the current trick suit is. All public announcements can be oberserved here so that the user has a better understanding of the changes to the Kripke models. In the image above you can find that player West had to change it's guess since it is not allowed for the sum of guess to be equal to the amount of tricks in the game.

#### Kripke Model Viewer

The right hand side of the screen shows an interactive Kripke Model viewer. The screen is continuosly redrawn so that we can make use of buttons to redraw parts of the viewer but also to make it independent of the game loop. The user can use the suit and rank buttons to select a card in the current game. The Kripke Model of that card is then visualized above the buttons. The model shows the knowledge of the current card.

In the image above the Kripke Model of the Queen of Hearts is visualized. The true world is shown by a golden box. Possible world relations are represented by colored lines where each color represents a player. Here Player west has the card in its hand and thus only considers the true world possible so there is no line being drawn. All other players consider it possible that all other players have the card except for the player himself.

We chose not to visualize reflexive relations since this would be redundant and it would result in a less clear visualisation.

### Kripke implementation

We build an agent that determines which card to play, based on Kripke knowledge. For every card in the game, the agent has a Kripke model with four different states. Each of the states correspond to one of the four players holding the card. Each of the agents have a set of relations between the possible states. We visualize the Kripke models using a graphical representation next to the game UI. A screenshot can be seen in figure 1.

<img src="kripke_model.png" alt="Example of the Kripke models"> -->

##### Formalization

Every time a player plays a card, he makes an announcement. By using Public Announcement Logic, we can reduce the amount of possible states in the Kripke models.

To formalize the model we use the following notation: _x_S_r_, where _x_ âˆˆ \{N, E, S, W\} which are the players, _S_ âˆˆ \{C, SP, H, D\} and _r_ âˆˆ \{A, K, Q, J, 10\}. This indicates that player _x_ has (and plays) a card with suit _S_ and rank _r_.

The full names and used abbreviations of the players, suits and ranks can be found in the table below.

##### Example 1 - Announcement 'Played card'

If player North plays the Ace of Spades, no one else can hold that card. Therefore, the kripke model of the Ace of Spades can be updated. All players only have a relation from the real world, to the real world (in which North is the owner of the Ace of Spades). After the update it is common knowledge that no one has that specific card anymore.
the public announcement changes the common knowledge as follows:

<img src="announcement_plays_card.png" alt="Formal definition of the announcement 'Played card'">

##### Example 2 - Announcement 'Does not have suit'

Consider the Kripke model of the Queen of Hearts. Player South does not hold the Queen of Hearts. Player North is the opener and starts the trick by playing the 10 of Hearts. Player East plays the Jack of Clubs. If Player East had a card of the Hearts suit (the trick suit), he was obligated to play it. Since he did not, player South now knows, that he does not have the Queen of Hearts and therefore has no Hearts suit at all. Therefore, every Player can update their knowledge on the cards that Player East holds. It is now common knowledge that Player East does not hold a card with suit Hearts.
In formal, the public announcement changes the common knowledge as follows:

### Strategy

The Geedy Kripke Agent uses the kripke models to determine which card to play. He is greedy, since he always tries to win the trick. Since a good strategy can become very complex (especially in a programming language), the rules are also presented in the graph below (made with draw.io).

Possible strategies are:

- When a player knows that he has the highest card of the trick suit, playing that card will often win the trick
- When a player does not have a card of the trick suit, he can play a trump card

The Greedy Kripke Agent has to make assumptions about the game in order to play a good strategy. The graph below one of the questions is "Does he have the highest trump card?". Using his knowledge about all possible trump cards in the game, the agent can make the right move. It is not always certain if the player has the highest trump card because he might consider it possible that one or more players still have higher trump cards.

The guessing is a very important part of the game. In the normal (non-simplified) version of the game a player can often win by guessing that he will not win a single trick. Players can actually receive bonus points when they guess 0 and the round contains more than 6 cards. When guessing 0 wins, the player has to switch to a whole new tactic which is not greedy. He has to make sure that he can throw away his high cards without ever winning a round with one. Since 'tactical guessing' results in rather complex behaviour we leave it as a possible extension for future work. However 'greedy guessing', guessing how much you will actually win, is implemented in our project. The Greedy Kripke Player has to make assumptions about the score of his cards based on the knowledge it has over the other cards and the current trump suit.

### Possible extensions

A possible extension for inferring tactis is implementing a (Deep) Q-Learning algorithm. Instead of implementing rules based on the knowledge base manually, we train a Q-Learning network to extract these rules and tactics itself. The network could have a Kripke model as an input as it is a perfect representation of the state.

The card game can be seen as a Markov Decision Process. We will define the state, action and reward as the following:

- State _S_: A list of 52 one hot encoded vectors (one for every card). Each card representation consist of 4 bits, one for every player. Here a 1 will represent a possible owner, and a 0 the opposite.
- Action _A_: A list of 52 possible cards to play. Since the player only has a subset of these cards, the possible actions can be reduced, based on the available cards.
- Reward _R(s,a)_: Results in a 1 for a win, and a 0 for a loss (we might consider adding a discount factor).

Using the representation of the MDP we can use Q-learning in combination with a multilayer perceptron as a function approximator. This function will approximate Policy P, which is choosing the action with the highest expected reward.

The implementation of such an algorithm is not the main goal of the course, but it could be interesting to combine Kripke models with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm. After training, the influence of different Kripke models on the tactics of the algorithm can be investigated. To see if the Kripke models can actually benifit the Q-learning agent, its performance could be compared to that of a greedy kripke agent (without Q-learning).
